# Scientific Program & Workshops

It is desirable but no mandatory for every participant to present their scientific work. This is an excellent opportunity to share your scientific expertise and connect with people interested in your topic.

We have two kinds of talks: 

- **Light talk:** 10 minutes talk + 5 minutes questions
- **Key talk (1 to 2 per day):** 25 minutes talk + 5 minutes questions 

A meaningful (*preliminary*) title should be given during registration to schedule talk sessions. As expected, we will provide a video projector (with VGA & HDMI ports) and a laser pointer for the presentations. 

Preliminary schedule of our scientific program. *TBA.*
